I'm pleased to announce my [recent win](https://devpost.com/software/permissioned-blocks) at the [Consensus 2017 Hackathon](https://consensus2017-blockchain.devpost.com/) in New York on the 21 May 2017 for [Permissioned Blocks](https://github.com/autocontracts/permissioned-blocks/blob/master/whitepaper.md). 

I applied the Permissioned Blocks technology to a micro-insurance challenge that the insurance company Swiss Re had presented. I demonstrated how this technology can streamline due diligence documentation gathering, and also to ensure blockchain privacy of sensitive information whilst at the same time being scalable solution.

You can also see a short video below of an online presentation of the Hackathon demo recorded during a [Sydney Ethereum Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SydEthereum/events/237360106/) hosted at the Atlassian offices on the 31 May 2017.

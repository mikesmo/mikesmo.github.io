[White Paper - Permissioned Blocks](https://github.com/autocontracts/permissioned-blocks) 

For the last 6 months I have been pretty busy developing a new technology that I've called <b>Permissioned Blocks</b>. This technology allows publishers to grant digital content rights in a decentralised p2p manner 
and also brings confidentiality to smart contract information when used on public blockchains such as [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/). 

Today, I am proud to say that I have completed the first working version and the following video that demonstrates permissioned blocks in action.

Highlights:

- 100% privacy of smart contract functional state information.
- Max throughput of 10,000 transactions per second (using [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) consensus engine).
- No gas required to be paid to miners.
- Decentralised solution using a folk of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for the secure storage of smart contract state.
- Compatible with any Turing Complete blockchain (e.g. [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/)). Decoupled and modular design.
- Multi user/role security capability model.  

A docker image will be provided soon on Github, so developers can run the demo and test it out.

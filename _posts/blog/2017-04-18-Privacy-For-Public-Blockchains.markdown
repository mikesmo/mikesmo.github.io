For the last 6 months I have been pretty busy developing a new technology that I've called <b>Permissioned Blocks</b>. This technology brings 
privacy, security and confidentiality to blockchains when using smart contracts.

Today, I am proud to say that I have completed the first working version and have produced a video to demonstrate permissioned blocks in action.

There is also a white paper draft detailing the engineering behind the technology that I am writing that will accompany this demo.

To summarise:

- A folk of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) has been used for securely storing smart contract state information.
- Using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) provides a decoupled and modular design, so that any blockchain that has smart contract features ([Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) etc) can use this technology.
- Multiple users can be granted various smart contract roles.
- No state information is stored on a smart contract. 

Below is a short video that demonstrates permissioned blocks in action:

A docker image of this demo will be provided shortly on Github, where you can also run this demo.

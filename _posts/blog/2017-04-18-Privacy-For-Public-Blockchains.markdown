For the last 6 months I have been pretty busy developing a new technology that I've called <b>Permissioned Blocks</b>. This technology brings 
privacy, security and confidentiality to blockchains when using smart contracts.

Today, I am  proud to say that I have completed the first working version.

There is also a white paper detailing the engineering behind the software and its full capabilities.

To summarise:

- A folk of IPFS has been used for securely storing smart contract state information.
- Using IPFS provides a decoupled and modular design, so that any blockchain that has smart contract features (Ethereum, Hyperledger etc) can use this technology.
- Multiple users can be granted various smart contract roles.
- No state information is stored on a smart contract. 

Below is a short video that demonstrates permissioned blocks in action:

A docker image of this demo will be provided shortly on Github, where you can also run this demo.


Please feel free to post any constructive comments or questions below and I'll do my best to reply.

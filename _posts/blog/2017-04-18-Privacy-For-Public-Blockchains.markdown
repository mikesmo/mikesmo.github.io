For the last 6 months I have been pretty busy developing a new technology that I've called <b>Permissioned Blocks</b>. This technology brings 
privacy, security and confidentiality to using smart contracts on public blockchains such as [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/). 

Today, I am proud to say that I have completed the first working version of this technology and the following video to demonstrate permissioned blocks in action.

The white paper draft detailing the engineering behind the technology that can be found here:

[White Paper - Permissioned Blocks](https://github.com/autocontracts/permissioned-blocks) 

Highlights:

- 100% privacy of smart contract functional state information.
- Max throughput of 10,000 transactions per second (using Tendermint consensus engine).
- No gas required to be paid to miners.
- Decentralised solution using a folk of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for the secure storage of smart contract state.
- Compatible with any Turing Complete blockchain (e.g. [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/)). Decoupled and modular design.
- Multi user/role security capability model.  

A docker image of this demo will be provided shortly on Github, where you can also run this demo.

Please feel free to post any comments or questions below and I'll do my best to reply.

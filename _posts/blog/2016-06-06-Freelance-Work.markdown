Well, I'm writing this blog post to mark the beginning of a journey that I'm about to take working as a Freelancer / Digital Nomad.
 
I have just filled out the application form with [TopTal](https://www.toptal.com/web) after a friend's recommendation. 
It took a while to gather all the information about my experience over the past 17 years, working for various
tech companies and places around the world. I'm still left with a nagging feeling that I haven't given the 
most clear picture of the depth of my knowledge and experience.

I was trying to explain this to my girlfriend, (who doesn't understand IT too well), how it is a challenge to try and describe 
everything that you know. My girlfriend said, "...but don't you just list all your skills in your CV?". I replied, "well it
 is a little more complicated than that". Firstly, I can't even remember all the complicated solutions that I've built over the years
 and the problems I've needed to solve. Secondly, there is so much detail that you just seem not to mention as it would bog down your CV with
  much too technical information.
 
For example, I was recently building a dockerised swarm of nodes for a blockchain network that I have been designing. I wanted to deploy it
on the Google Engine cloud services using dockerised container managed by Kubernetes. It was a lot of engineering effort to get it all to work, and took me a week to build. Mainly 
because there needed to be high availability of the system, if one of the nodes went down, it needed to automatically be restored without
affecting the other nodes in the network from processing transactions. It's not your standard client / web server design and 
because I'm cutting new ground, there just is not much/any documentation out there that you can refer to help guide you along the way.

Does my CV mention any of this? Well, no. But why, you may ask? 

Well, if I included these skills my CV, then it would be like War & Peace, and
not the two pages expected by most employers and recruiters. Also, most hiring departments just want to know whether you are a capable 
 Front-end developer or a Database developer? Then they will pass your CV to the team the is looking for a the new hire.

So why am I becoming a Freelance / Digital Nomad?

After working on various startups in the last couple of years I have now become accustomed to working in a more
creative and flexible manner. I also seemed not to be permanently based in one place these days. I tend to be moving between 
London, Sydney, Spain and the US as I become more involved with blockchain development community, giving various talks on the subject and 
entering hackathons. By working as a Digital Nomad I hope this will give me the flexibility that I need to continue my work.

I am looking forward to this new journey and hope that there are some interesting projects that await!
